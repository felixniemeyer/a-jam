/* How this issue tracking file works: 
	- most recent entries are added on top
	- entries can be broken down, which is expressed by indentation
	- prepending the following prefixes has the following meaning: 
		- "D([<comment>]): " = done
		- "R([<comment>]): " = removed
		- "WIP([<name>]): " = work started by <name> at <date>
