/ How this issue tracking file works: 
	- most recent entries are added on top
	- entries can be broken down, which is expressed by indentation
	- prepending the following prefixes has the following meaning: 
		- "D[(<comment>)]: " = done
		- "WIP[(<name>)]: " = work started by <name> at <date>
*/

- Backlog 
	- copy local session to global session on publish cid available
	- fix bug, that sometimes recording/playback stop unexpectedly (escape during loop record) 
	- hide keyboard shortcuts on mobile
	- create blob when importing from file => so that publishing is possible

- V5
	- D: remove cid from recent session buttons, make date larger

- V4 
	- D: ipfs interface interface
		- D: pinata integration
		- D: await browser node (especially for "load session" - causes error there) 
	- D: public node: support https 
	- D: Three possible ipfs nodes
		- D: public node (via ipfs-http-client)
		- D: configurable node (via ipfs-http-client) 
			- hint to configure cors headers 
				- should allow <a-jam-ipns>.*
		- D: browser node
	- D: Use all 3 options if configured for pinning
	- D: Use for requesting: configurable node > public node > browser node
		- D: Allow switch for browser node > public node
		- D: store setting in local storage
	- D: Set up a free ipfs node that a-jam connects to
		- once a-jam get's bigger, prevent abuse 
			- use nginx in front of ipfs & authenticate requests
		- D: have a job, that notes down all pins and removes all pins that are older than y
	- D: Dark mode (or simply dark style over all - no choice) 

- V3
	- Architectural 
		- D(decided against): Vuex
		- D: Vue Router (to enable browser back and forth buttons, bookmarks...)
		- D: Segregate track data and audio nodes
		- D: use "defineComponent" instead of classes
	- Features 
		- D: Export master audio
		- D: Loop playback
			- D: generate a new recording in every loop, choose the best loop afterwards!
		- Convenient Merge Tools
			- on page trackinfo, click "merge session" 
			- Show recent sessions
			- click one => Merge
				- Track names if <> => "old << new"
				- Session name "old << new"
			- import track from another session => button under the tracks
				- shows recent session
				- click one => shows tracks from this other session 
				- click one => loads this track into the current session
		- D: import audio
			- by cid
			- from file
		- D: Mute, Solo tracks
		- Select playback time
			- Create start flags
	- Track Settings
		- D(in V2): Offset
		- Filter
			- Reverb
			- Delay
			- ...
	- Improve Loading times and availability
		- Pinning Service(s) integration
			- Configure pinning service in settings
			- Promt for pinning service on publish
		- IPFS
			- try to connect to a local node before spawning a js-ipfs node https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/packages/ipfs-http-client#getting-started
			- pin a foreign project on local ipfs node on load
				- enable automatic in settings (default: auto) 
				- manually in session settings
		- Ask ipfs community for help with connecting to session origin
			- Post list of connection failures
	- Jam session config object versions and migrations
	- D: Sharing links only one line high (it's enough), maybe make them wider? 100% - 2em? left: 1em
	- Do some manual work and hardcode some offsets for different browsers
		- chrome, chromium, brave
		- firefox
		- safari
		- mobile 
			- chrome, brave 
			- firefox 
			- safari
		- try to cover 90% of all used browsers
		- this make wide adoption possible, it's a major hurdle 
	- D: enhance "tracks"-layout and timebar etc. by using a wrapper div and abs posistioning
		- wrapper
			- scrolling content
			- abs positioned stuff
	- Playback delay: 
		- add the 5 ms on playback, not on the track (possible: delay and offset are both set) 
		- => this will make sure the track offset equals the default track offset (instead now: track offset = default + 5)
	- D: Choose recording device in the settings and/or on first recording: mediaDevices.enumerateDevices

- D: Hotfixes 
	- D: implement a "save-input" button, that 
		- fixes body width on focus
		- releases the fix on blur
		- so that on mobile bringin up the keyboar would not affect the layout
		- alternative: fix width on menu entry
	- D: ajam => a-jam title

- D: pre release
	- D(removed reconstruction from end time + introduced default rec offset): Reduce latency (firefox e.g.) 
	- D: make default recording offset configurable
	- D: enable remove track

- D: documentation improvement
	- add ipfs explanation and link to ipfs.io to readme

- D(not possible, need help from ipfs expert): ipfs enhancements
	- add /p2p of publishing node to publishing link and connect to it for loading
	- connect /p2p address of davids raspberry => hardcode it 

- D: V2
	- D: recent projects
	- D: track adjustments: 
		- should work immedeately
		- volume
		- panning
	- D: play time & total time at the bottom
	- D: initial project maxduration = 10s => make it clear, what happens when recording
	- D: show recording placeholder while recording
		- thinner, without label, red
	- D: stop all audio sources on session leave

- D: pre release: 
	- remove small margin that causes scrolling in session view
	- add pics to the issue
	- release
	- send to Radu

- D: V1
	- programming: 
		- edit track names
		- show share links:  "click to copy": 
			- cid
			- ipfs-link
			- gateway 
		- load from ipfs
	- publishing
		- upload on ipfs
		- name it
