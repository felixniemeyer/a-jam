# Jam
Record tracks, share with others, let them add tracks = jam asynchronously. 
Web app will be hosted on IPFS. 
Projects and audio will be stored on IPFS as well. 

Motivation: 
- have a way for remotely making music with my mates. 
- promote decentral technologies. 
## Developping
### Build
Run `npm run sass` to build `style.css` from `style.scss`
### About js packages
We don't use Webpack or anything to package the code into one file, because we want to leverage, that many programs use the same js packages
